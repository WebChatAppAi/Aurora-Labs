```yaml
# Aurora automatically creates this configuration file
# Usually located at: ~/Documents/Aurora/models.yaml

aurora:
  version: "2.0.0"
  models_path: "./models"  # Path to your Aurora AI models

models:
  aurora_melody_v2:
    enabled: true
    priority: 1  # Higher priority models load first

  aurora_harmony:
    enabled: true
    priority: 2
```
